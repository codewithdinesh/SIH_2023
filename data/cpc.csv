1[WRITTEN STATEMENT, SET-OF AND COUNTER-CLAIM]

1[1. Written statement.


The defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence.


Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons.]


1. Subs, by Act No. 46 of 1999, section 18. Now again substituted by Act No. 22 of 2002 section 9 (w.e.f. 1-7-2002).


1[1A. Duty of defendant to produce documents upon which relief is claimed or relied upon by him

(2) Where any such document is not in possession or power of the defendant, he shall, wherever possible, state in whose possession or power it is.


2(3) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the defendant under this rule, but, is not so produced shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing of the suit.].

2. New facts must be specially pleaded.


The defendant must raise by his pleading all matters which show the suit not be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the plaint, as, for instance, fraud, limitation, release, payment, performance, or facts showing illegality.


3. Denial to be specific


It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his written statement to deny generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth, except damages.


4. Evasive denial.


Where a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus, if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances.


5. Specific denial.


1[(1)] Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability :


Provided that the Court may in it discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.


2[(2) Where the defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be lawful for the Court to pronounce judgment on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but the Court may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved.


(3) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to sub-rule (1) or under sub-rule (2), the Court shall have due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader.


(4) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule, a decree shall be drawn up in accordance with such judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.]

2. Ins. by Act No. 104 of 1976 (w.e.f. 1-2-1977).


6. Particulars of set-off to be given in written statement.


(1) Where in a suit for the recovery of money the defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and both parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not afterwards unless permitted by the Court, presents a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to be set-off.


(2) Effect of set-off?The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off: but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree.


(3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a claim of set-off.


Illustrations


(a) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration to B's effect, C pays Rs. 1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of Rs. 1,000.


(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B, C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A.


(c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable to him in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off.


(d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims being both definite, pecuniary demands may be set-off.


(e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for as soon as A recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands.


(f) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000 C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone.


(g) A sues B and C for Rs. 1000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A.


(h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000 B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt of Rs. 1,500 due in his separate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000.

COMMENTS


(i) Order allowing proposed amendment would not also come under clause (b) of section 115(1). Under revisional powers of High Court this cannot be interfered with by High Court. Prem Bakshi v. Dharam Dev, AIR 2002 SC 559.


(ii) The objections filed by the petitioners were under Order 21, rule 36 C.P.C. and the only remedy against it is revision under section 115 C.P.C. The Appellate Authority has rightly dismissed the appeal in limine as not maintainble; Naresh Sharma v. Ramesh Chand, AIR 2000 HP 6.


(iii) Revisional court ought to consider and discuss evidence on which finding was based by lower authorities. Mere statement by Revisional court that there was evidence to show that the bona fides of the landlord was proved is not sufficient; K. Urmila v. Ram Kumar Verma, AIR 1998 SC 1188.

(vi) Revision against an Order admitting documents after arguments were over is not maintainable; Hemendra Chaudhary v. M/s. Punjab National Bank, AIR 1993 All 49: 1993(21) All LR 218: 1993 All LJ 76.


(vii) Ex parte decree of ejectment?Revision against?Death of one of the co-landlords during pendency of the revision?No substitution?Held, revision would not abate; Ram Gopal Sharma v. Ist Additional District Judge, Meerut, AIR 1993 All 124: 1992 All CJ 1026.


(viii) Revisional court is not competent to reappreciate evidence; Padartha Amat v. Siba Sahu, AIR 1993 Ori 92.


(ix) Under section 115 of the Code, the High Court connot reappreciate the evidence and cannot set aside the concurrent findings of the Courts below by taking a different view of the evidence. The High Court is empowered only to interfare with the findings of fact if the findings are perverse or there has been a non-appreciation or non-consideration of the material evidence on record by the Courts below.

COMMENTS


(i) The principle of res judicata is a procedural provision. A jurisdictional question if wrongly decided would not attract the principles of res judicata. When an Order is passed without jurisdiction, the same becomes a nullity. When an Order is a nullity, it cannot be supported by invoking procedural principle; Management of Sonepat Co-op. Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Ajit Singh, AIR 2005 SC 1050.


(ii) There is a distinction between issue estoppel and res judicata. Res judicata debars a court from exercising its jurisdiction to determine the lis if it has attained finality whereas the doctrine of issue estoppel is invoked against the party. If such issue is decided against him, he would be estopped from raising the same in the latter proceedings. The doctrine of res judicata creats a different kind of estoppel viz. estoppel by Accord; Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar, AIR 2005 SC 626.


(iii) First writ petition filed on the ground of apprehended bias and subsequent second petition was filed on allegations of actual bias, is not barred by res judicata; G.N. Nayak v. Goa University, AIR 2002 SC 790.


(iv) Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure has no doubt some technical aspects for instance the rule of constructive res judicata may be said to be technical but the basis of which the said rule rests is founded on the consideration of public policy; Sumer Mal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 2000 Raj 1.


(v) The technical principle of res judicata would not be operative more so, if substantial change in circumstances is averred and found prima facie justified; Smt. Rehana Parveen v. Naimuddin, AIR 2000 MP 1.


(vi) Assuming, the cause of action in both the suits was based upon title in the suit land and was akin in all the cases, yet, as referred to above, in as much the earlier two suits were dismissed as withdrawn with permission to file fresh on the same cause of action, third suit will not be barred by any principle of law; Harbhagwan v. Smt. Punni Devi, AIR 1999 P&H 223.


(vii) Where the Sangh has been duly represented in the previous court proceedings and were litigating bona fidely which resulted in failure cannot be allowed to lay any objection in execution or to plead nullity of decree hence doctrine of res judicata applies. The decree of ejectment will bind every member of Sangh; Singhai Lal Chand Jain v. Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh, Panna, JT 1996(3) SC 64.
